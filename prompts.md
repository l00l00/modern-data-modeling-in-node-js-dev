# promps
To craft a comprehensive wiki for your project on **TypeScript Data Modeling in Node.js**, the outline you've shared serves as a solid starting point. We can break this down into prompts based on each section, where I will fill in detailed information under each heading. Here's how the prompts would be structured:

### Prompts Breakdown

**Prompt 1**: 
- Introductory sections: `Introduction`, `Tech Stack`
- Overview of the project, the problem it solves, and the stack used. 

**Prompt 2**: 
- Setup instructions: `Installation`, `Project Structure`
- Detailed steps for installation, explanation of project structure, and how the directories and files are organized.

**Prompt 3**: 
- `Data Modeling Overview`: Includes the concept of SQL vs. NoSQL, and general guidelines for using ORMs in TypeScript.
- Discuss data modeling principles, key differences between SQL and NoSQL, and how TypeScript integrates into this.

**Prompt 4**: 
- Deep dive into ORMs: `TypeORM`, `Prisma`, and `Mongoose`.
- Provide real-world examples and code samples on how to use these ORMs in TypeScript for data modeling and interaction with databases.

**Prompt 5**: 
- `Modeling Relationships`
- Explains how relationships like one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many are modeled in SQL and NoSQL databases, and how to manage them using TypeORM, Prisma, and Mongoose.

**Prompt 6**: 
- `Schema Validation`
- Discuss schema validation strategies using TypeScript. Explore validation libraries or built-in ORM support for validation (e.g., class-validator for TypeORM).

**Prompt 7**: 
- `Migrations`
- Cover migrations, how to run them, and how schema evolution works for SQL and NoSQL databases in Node.js, focusing on TypeORM and Prisma.

**Prompt 8**: 
- `Best Practices`
- Highlight best practices for database design, optimization strategies, schema evolution, and managing migrations effectively in TypeScript and Node.js.

**Prompt 9**: 
- `Learning Resources`
- Provide resources for further learning, including documentation, tutorials, courses, and books.
