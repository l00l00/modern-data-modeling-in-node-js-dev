### Introduction

This project is a **comprehensive guide** to **data modeling** using **TypeScript** in a **Node.js** environment. It focuses on teaching the best practices for modeling data in both **SQL** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and **NoSQL** (e.g., MongoDB) databases. Data modeling involves defining the structure, relationships, and constraints of the data stored in a database. It is crucial for ensuring data integrity, efficiency, and maintainability.

With the increasing popularity of TypeScript, combining strong typing with powerful ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) like **TypeORM**, **Prisma**, and **Mongoose** allows developers to manage databases effectively and write scalable, type-safe applications. This guide will cover essential aspects of data modeling in Node.js, starting from defining entities and attributes to implementing complex relationships, schema validation, and migrations.

You will learn:
- How to define data models for SQL and NoSQL databases using TypeScript.
- The differences between SQL and NoSQL databases and how to choose the right one for your project.
- How to use popular ORMs (TypeORM, Prisma, and Mongoose) to manage database interactions in a type-safe way.
- How to validate schemas to ensure data consistency.
- Best practices for handling database migrations and schema changes.

By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll have a solid foundation in data modeling with TypeScript, allowing you to design robust, maintainable applications that efficiently interact with SQL or NoSQL databases.

### Tech Stack

In this project, we will be using the following technologies:

- **Node.js (v16+)**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, widely used for building scalable backend applications.
- **TypeScript (v4+)**: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types, making the code easier to manage and less prone to runtime errors.
- **TypeORM**: A popular ORM for SQL databases, particularly useful for TypeScript as it provides decorators and type-safety.
- **Prisma**: A modern ORM that focuses on database access in a type-safe way and simplifies database migrations for SQL databases.
- **Mongoose**: A MongoDB object data modeling (ODM) library that provides a schema-based solution to model data in NoSQL databases.
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL**: SQL databases used for demonstrating relational data modeling.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to demonstrate modeling in document-based databases.
