### Installation

To run the project locally, you need to have **Node.js** and **TypeScript** installed. We will guide you through the installation steps and ensure all required packages are properly set up for database interaction, migrations, and schema management.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typescript-data-modeling-nodejs.git
cd typescript-data-modeling-nodejs
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
After cloning, install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

This will install all the necessary packages, including **TypeORM**, **Prisma**, **Mongoose**, and other dependencies.

#### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to store environment-specific variables such as database connection strings.

```bash
# .env file

# For SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb"

# For MongoDB
MONGODB_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb"
```

#### Step 4: Run Database Migrations
If your project requires migrations (we'll cover this in more detail later), run the migration scripts to set up the initial database schema:

For TypeORM:
```bash
npm run typeorm migration:run
```

For Prisma:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will initialize your database with the required tables or collections.

#### Step 5: Start the Application
Once everything is set up, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start your Node.js server with TypeScript, and the application will be ready to handle database operations.

### Project Structure

The project is structured to maintain separation between different concerns like models, migrations, controllers, and services. Here's an overview of the folder structure:

```
/src
  ├── /models        # Data models (TypeORM, Prisma, or Mongoose schemas)
  ├── /controllers   # Controllers for handling API requests
  ├── /services      # Business logic and database interaction
  ├── /migrations    # Migration files for SQL databases (TypeORM/Prisma)
  ├── /routes        # API routes
  ├── /utils         # Utility functions (e.g., error handling, validation)
  └── index.ts       # Entry point of the application
```

#### Key Directories:

- **/models**: This folder contains all the data models for your entities. Depending on the ORM used (TypeORM, Prisma, or Mongoose), the structure and format of models will vary.
  
- **/controllers**: Controllers are responsible for handling API requests and interacting with services to perform database operations.

- **/services**: This directory contains the business logic of the application. Here, the interaction between the controller and the database is managed.

- **/migrations**: Contains migration scripts for SQL databases. These scripts handle database schema evolution and data transformations.

- **/routes**: API routes for mapping incoming HTTP requests to their respective controllers.

Once you're ready, say "Next," and we'll proceed to **Data Modeling Overview** where we discuss SQL vs. NoSQL, and the role of ORMs in TypeScript.
